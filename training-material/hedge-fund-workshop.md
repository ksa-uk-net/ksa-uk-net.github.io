## Understanding Hedge Funds  
## An Educational Workshop

This half-day workshop is designed to provide an educational grounding in the
basics of hedge funds. No prior knowledge or experience of hedge funds is
necessary.

The course will empower you to make informed decisions about the inclusion of
hedge funds within an investment portfolio. It will provide you with a full
understanding of the risks associated with different types of strategies. It
will enable you to direct educated questions to hedge fund managers about their
funds. It will help you anticipate the practical and administrative aspects of
investing in hedge funds.

Convened at your offices, the workshop can be held at a time that is convenient
for all participants. The sessions are non-technical and participative, with
questions and discussion encouraged throughout. Hard copies of all course
materials are included.

The workshop is run by Karen Shackleton, a director of KSA. ([See
